* What is active learning in pedagogy?
** objectives
course delivery method emphasizing interactions between
- students and teachers
- students and students
- students and the course itself

** benefits
- engaging :: project based learning encourages participation
- adaptable :: student reactions can be used to influence course delivery

** Requirements
these objectives are *data-driven*
1. collect student feedback
2. process student feedback (=teacherspyt= lives here)
3. reward student feedback 

* Purdue University resources 
multiple investments support active learning techniques

** Purdue based services
- [[https://engineering.purdue.edu/coursemirror/][CourseMIRROR]] aids collecting continuous student feedback
- [[https://www.purdue.edu/activelearning/index.php][Wilmeth Active Learning Center]] modern classroom and library complex
- [[https://www.lib.purdue.edu/][Purdue digital library]] multidisciplinary array of research databases

** Third party services available through Purdue
- [[https://www.itap.purdue.edu/services/qualtrics.html][Qualtrics]] 

* Being an effective TA in active learning
** two complimentary tasks
1. monitor and motivate student interactions
2. keep professor informed of student feedback

** grading
active learning courses typically grade both
- performance
- participation

=teacherspyt= currently provides tools for participation grading

** lesson planning
The course itself is flexible at the professor's discretion
- tune course material to student ability and interests
  - specify projects + homework based on student's interests
  - review and/or restructure lectures according to feedback
- quantifiable students are rewarded for participation and performance

* Grade qualtrics survey using teacherspyt
** set up survey
An example of a valid survey is included in the =teacherspyt=
repository as a Qualtrics survey file (qsf)

1. [[https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/#ImportingASurvey][import]] to Qualtrics, modify, and deploy to students.
2. export collected data to tabular format of choice

Qualtrics makes it easy to customize a survey, but it is important to
follow the template to ensure =teacherspyt= works correctly.

** initialize grading session
#+begin_src jupyter-python
  import pandas as pd
  import teacherspyt
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** read data to dataframe
#+begin_src jupyter-python
  df = pd.read_excel(
      "~/vm/shared/post-parlay-survey-POLYMERS.xlsx",
      header=[0,1]
  ).dropna(how='all')
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** use teacherspyt dataframe accessor to easily summarize data
